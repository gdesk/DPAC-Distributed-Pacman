# DPAC-Distributed-Pacman
Project for the courses of Software System Development @ Unibo - Ingegneria e Scienze Informatiche - Cesena - A.Y. 2016/17 

We want to reproduce the famous Pacman game by Tohru Iwatani in a distributed and multiplayer form: 
- a Player can choose the character for the game between pacman and some kind of ghosts, and the map from a wide selection. 
- the game is very similar from the original one, depending on the choosed character.
- you can unlock new characters and power up by increasing your score
